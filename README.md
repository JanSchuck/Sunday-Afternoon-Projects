# Sunday-Afternoon-Projects
Projects in this folder have the claim to quickly and easily solve a problem that I encounter in everyday life. They are not perfect and serve only to fulfill their purpose

## PhoHiCreat
The goal for the PhotoHighlightManager was to create a software where you can browse through a big ammount of photos quickly and copy your favourite photos to a highlight folder.
After a long vacation in canada I faced the problem to have a hugh ammount of pictures +4000 from which I wanted to use the best for a diashow. Moving every image by hand seemed to take way to long so I came up with this idea.
First you need to enter a source folder. The software checks if the directory is existing.
Second you need to enter a highlight folder. If the directory doesnt exist yet you can create one by hitting enter while in the highlight textbox.
If both paths are valid they turn green.
After entering the source folder the first picture is displayed in the window. The image display takes up the most ammount of the window for obvious reasons.
To browse quickly through the pictures you are able to navigate with the left and right key. With the enter key you can copy an image to the highlight folder.
